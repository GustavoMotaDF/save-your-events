# About
Losing events is not an option!
A relay can cease to exist at any time, erasing its entire history, causing users to lose their events.
This is a situation no one should have to go through!
Get your events while you can and throw them into any other relays you deem necessary. 

# Check the 'setup.sh' file
Check the TOR_DIR variable in the file and change it if necessary.
This variable contains the directory to be mounted on the host to persist the information.

# Run docker compose

- Download all files
- run file: `./setup.sh`
- access in the browser http://localhost:8084
